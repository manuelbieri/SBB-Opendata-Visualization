## Remarks about the estimated arrival time
Not for all connections the estimated arrival times are available, thus producing NaNs in the output table
of the merged data (this entries are styled red in the output).

These connections are ignored by the Visualization, thus some days are represented only with a few connections.

Exemplary dates with lot of missing values are:
- 15.1.2021
- 27.1.2021
- 28.3.2021
